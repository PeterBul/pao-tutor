# PAO Tutor

Go to https://peterbul.github.io/pao-tutor/ for the deployed application

A very simple project for doing daily memory practice.

10 numbers are generated and cycled through. It is not possible to go back to a previous number. Once everything is cycled through, the goal is to remember as many as possible.

Remembering the 10 numbers is not really that difficult. The goal is to actually practice daily review of 10 of my PAO (Person Action Object) system associations. Remembering numbers is a good way to put the use of the associations into practice. The goal is therefore to have associations come faster.

## Why not dynamic number of values

I want to keep the app very simple. I also don't want myself to be tempted to do more than 10 numbers and start having longer and longer sequences. The use of the app should be a quick habit that is used every day.

## Running locally

The app is created with Vite and Typescript. Just run

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

to start the app locally.
